# SEO Management

Using:
  *  .NET Core 2.2
  *  Microsoft Identity
  *  Entity Framework Core
  *  SendGrid
  *  MS SQL
  
  
  The idea of this project was to allow a third party to manage H1, Meta Titles and Meta Descriptions with my views.  All my product data was being brought in from database to three different views.  So, the idea was to have each view dynamically populate its title, h1 and description based on it's url path.  That table linking url paths to SEO keywords would be maintained by a 3rd party, the SEO Management team, using this website. 
  
  This project was also an exercise in adding Identity to an already existing project with my notes here: [Notes on Adding .NET Core 2.2 Identity to Existing Project](https://www.catrina.me/notes-on-adding-net-core-2-2-identity-to-existing-project/)
